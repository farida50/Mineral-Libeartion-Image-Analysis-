# Mineral-Liberation-Image-Analysis-
This repository contains the Python-based automated image processing pipeline developed to predict mineral liberation behavior from polished section SEM images of chalcopyrite and pyrite.

## Features

- Image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, Gaussian filtering)
- Adaptive thresholding and morphological operations
- Connected component analysis for grain detection
- Grain size distribution and liberation percentage calculation
- Batch processing support

## How to Run

1. Install required Python packages:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pandas seaborn jupyter


## Project Structure

- `data/`: SEM images and input data files
- `outputs/`: Results such as CSV files and labeled images
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages needed
- `LICENSE`: License information
