# Mineral-Liberation-Image-Analysis-
This repository contains the Python-based automated image processing pipeline developed to predict mineral liberation behavior from polished section SEM images of chalcopyrite and pyrite.

## Features

- Image preprocessing (grayscale conversion, Gaussian filtering)
- Adaptive thresholding and morphological operations
- Connected component analysis for grain detection
- Grain size distribution and liberation percentage calculation
- Batch processing support

## How to Run

1. Install required Python packages:
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pandas seaborn jupyter


## Repository Structure

- `src/` - Python source code modules
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis and visualization
- `data/` - Sample SEM images for testing
- `outputs/` - Example output files (CSV, labeled images)
